# Hypixel API with GraphQL
In my quest to learn about GraphQL using Node.js and Express, I decided to use the public Hypixel API as a "tool" to build a GraphQL schema in a practical environment, not in a theoretical environment with some bogus data.

After a couple of hours of setting everything up, looking through the response from the Hypixel API, building the GraphQL schema and parsing the JSON response from the Hypixel API into the schema, I decided to publish what I already have on GitHub and make the repository public.

If anyone is interested in helping with expanding the GraphQL schema that I already have, so that it will eventually cover all the data returned in the JSON responses from the Hypixel API, and to make it something that developers can really benefit from.
